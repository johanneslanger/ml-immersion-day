You don't know which values of the eta, alpha, min_child_weight, and max_depth hyperparameters to use to train the best model. To find the best values for these hyperparameters, you can specify ranges of values that Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning searches to find the combination of values that results in the training job that performs the best as measured by the objective metric that you chose. Hyperparameter tuning launches training jobs that use hyperparameter values in the ranges that you specified, and returns the training job with highest auc.\n"

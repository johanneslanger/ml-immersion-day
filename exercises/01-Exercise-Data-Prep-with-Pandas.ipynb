    "Losing customers is costly for any business.  Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay.  This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. ML models rarely give perfect predictions though, so this notebook is also about how to incorporate the relative costs of prediction mistakes when determining the financial outcome of using ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a familiar example of churn: leaving a mobile phone operator.  Seems like one can always find fault with their provider du jour! And if the provider knows that a customer is thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives - such as a phone upgrade or perhaps having a new feature activated – and the customer may stick around. Incentives are often much more cost-effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.\n",

    "Mobile operators have historical records on which customers ultimately ended up churning and which continued using the service. We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. Of course, we expect the model to make mistakes. After all, predicting the future is tricky business! But we'll learn how to deal with prediction errors.\n",
